section of a display screen where a negative slope line segment is to be plotted , 
starting from the pixel at column 50 on scan line 50.
starting from the left endpoint at pixel position(50, 50). select the next pixel position as (51, 50)
or as (51, 49) testing the sign of an integer parameter whose value is proportional to the difference between 
the vertical separations of the two pixel positions from teh actual line path.
first consider the scan conversion process for lines with positive slope less than 1.0. Pixel positions 
along a line path are by sampling at unit x intervals . 
starting from the left end point (x0, y0) of a given line, we step each successive column(x position)
and plot the pixel whose scan-line y value is closest to the line path.
Assuming that we have determined that the pixel at(x(k), y(k)) is to be displayed we need to decide
which pixel to plot in column x(k+1) = x(k)+1
pixels at positions(x(k+1), y(k)) and (x(k)+1, y(k)+1)
At sampling position x(k)+1, we label vertical pixel separations from the mathematical line path as d(lower)
and d(upper).

y = m(xk+1) + b
d(lower) = y-yk = m(xk+1)+b-yk
d(upper) = (yk + 1)-y = (yk + 1)- m(xk+1)-b

to determine the closest pixel to the line path, set up an efficient test based on the difference between 
the two pixel separations :

d(lower) - d(upper)= 2m(xk+1)- 2yk + 2b -1
decision parameter pk for the kth step in the line algorithm can be obtained by rearranging 
so that it involves only int calculations .
m=delta(y)/delta(x)
p(k) = deltax(x)(d(lower)-d(upper)) = (2(delta(y))).xk - (2(delta(x))). yk + c

for the colum table look at the notebook .
among the various pocessors available. One approach to the partitioning problem is to adapt an existing sequential 
algorithm to take advantage of multiple processors 
given ,
np processors , set up a parallel Bresenham algorithm by subdividing the line path into np partitions 
The distance between beginning x positions of the adjacent partitions can be calculated as :

delta(xp) = (delta(x)+np-1)/np
delta(x) is the width of the line and the value for partition of adjacent partitions can be calculated as :

we calculate the starting x coordinate for the kth partition as :
xk = x0 + kdelta(xp)
if we have np = 4 processors , with delta(x)=15
