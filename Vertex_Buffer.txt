vertex buffer ---> its a memory buffer (array of memory of bytes of buffer)
define a bunch of data that represents a triangle .
we need to tell the GPU to tell to draw the triangle 
shader is the program running on a GPU.
OpenGL operates as a state machine --> that means we dont have to necessarily treat as an object 
what we do instead is we set a series of states , what it dies it it tells that it needs to draw some specific 
buffer or a shader.

glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES);
glVertex2f(-0.5f, -0.5f);
glVertex2f(0.0f, 0.5f);
glVertex2f(0.5f, -0.5f);
glEnd();
