sets the mouse callback for the current window .
usage :
void glutMouseFunc(void (*func)(int button, int state, int x, int y));
func:
The new mouse callback function.
when user presses and releases mouse buttons in the window,when we press and release the mouse 
the mouse callback is generated .
Button parameter is one of GLUT_LEFT_BUTTON, GLUT_MIDDLE_BUTTON, OR GLUT_RIGHT_BUTTON.
not possible to generate only a GLUT_LEFT_BUTTON callback.
state parameter ---> either GLUT_UP or GLUT_DOWN for indcating that whether the callback was due to the release
or press .
The x and y callback parameters indicate the window relative coordinates when the mouse button 
state changed . if a menuy is attached to a button for a window , mouse callbacks for the same button
will be generated (assuming the window still has a mouse callback registered) when the mouse button is released
even if the mouse has moved outside the window.

During a mouse callback, glutGetModifiers may be called to determine the state of modifier keys when the mouse 
event generating the callback occured.

passing null to glutMouseFunc disables the generation of mouse callbacks.
