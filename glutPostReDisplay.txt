marks the current window as needing to be redisplayed.
Usage :
void glutPostReDisplay(void);
Description:
Mark the normal plane of current window as needing to be redisplayed. 
Next iteration through glutMainLoop,
the window's display callback will be called to redisplay the window's normal plane.
Multiple calls to glutPostReDisplay before the next display callback opportunity generates 
only a single redisplay callback to re-mark that window for redisplay.

Logically, normal plane damage notification for a window is treated as a glutPostRedisplay on the damaged 
window. Unlike damage reported by the window system, glutPostReDisplay will not set to true the normal 
plane's damaged status (returned by glutLayerGet(GLUT_NORMAL_DAMAGED)).
